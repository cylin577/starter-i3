# Starter-i3
Make i3 easy.
## Why?
I recently switched to i3 and found out that it's super **fast**, **lightweight** yet still **looks good**, but that requires some configuration, and most ppl don't want to do that, so I created this repo to help new user get i3 working and looking good **fast**!
## How to use

To use the pack,  first you ```git clone https://github.com/cylin577/starter-i3``` 
then  ```cd starter-i3``` and finally ```sudo bash ./geti3.sh```  


Oh forgot to say, the $mod key is set to the windows key. So if you see $mod key, replace it to the windows key in your head
